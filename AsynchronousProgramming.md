# Asynchronous Programming in Web Development

## Introduction

In web development, asynchronous programming is notorious for being a challenging topic.

An asynchronous operation is one that allows the computer to “move on” to other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete. Asynchronous programming means that time-consuming operations don’t have to bring everything else in our programs to a halt.

There are countless examples of asynchronicity in our everyday lives. Cleaning our house, for example, involves asynchronous operations such as a dishwasher washing our dishes or a washing machine washing our clothes. While we wait on the completion of those operations, we’re free to do other chores.

Similarly, web development makes use of asynchronous operations. Operations like making a network request or querying a database can be time-consuming, but JavaScript allows us to execute other tasks while awaiting their completion.


This lesson will teach you how modern JavaScript handles asynchronicity using the ` Promise ` object, Let’s get started!

## What is a Promise?

Promises are objects that represent the eventual outcome of an asynchronous operation. A Promise object can be in one of three states:

- **Pending:** The initial state— the operation has not completed yet.
- **Fulfilled:** The operation has completed successfully and the promise now has a resolved value. For example, a request’s promise might resolve with a JSON object as its value.
- **Rejected:** The operation has failed and the promise has a reason for the failure. This reason is usually an Error of some kind.

We refer to a promise as settled if it is no longer pending— it is either fulfilled or rejected. Let’s think of a dishwasher as having the states of a promise:

- **Pending:** The dishwasher is running but has not completed the washing cycle.
- **Fulfilled:** The dishwasher has completed the washing cycle and is full of clean dishes.
- **Rejected:** The dishwasher encountered a problem (it didn’t receive soap!) and returns unclean dishes.

If our dishwashing promise is fulfilled, we’ll be able to perform related tasks, such as unloading the clean dishes from the dishwasher. If it’s rejected, we can take alternate steps, such as running it again with soap or washing the dishes by hand.<br>

A JavaScript `Promise` object can be in one of three states:`pending`, `resolved`, or `rejected`.

While the value is not yet available, the`Promise` stays in the `pending` state. Afterwards, it transitions to one of the two states: `resolved` or `rejected`.

A `resolved` promise stands for a successful completion. Due to errors, the promise may go in the `rejected` state.

In the example code block, if the `Promise` is on `resolved` state, the first parameter holding a callback function of the `.then()` method will print the resolved value. Otherwise, an alert will be shown.

```javaScript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const res = true;
  // An asynchronous operation.
  if (res) {
    resolve('Resolved!');
  }
  else {
    reject(Error('Error'));
  }
});

promise.then((res) => console.log(res), (err) => alert(err));

```
<br>
<hr>
## The .catch() method for handling rejection

The function passed as the second argument to a `.then()` method of a promise object is used when the promise is rejected. An alternative to this approach is to use the JavaScript `.catch()` method of the promise object. The information for the rejection is available to the handler supplied in the `.catch()` method.

```javaScript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {  
  setTimeout(() => {
    reject(Error('Promise Rejected Unconditionally.'));
  }, 1000);
});

promise.then((res) => {
  console.log(value);
});

promise.catch((err) => {
  alert(err);
});
```
<br>
<hr>
<br>

## JavaScript Promise.all()

The JavaScript Promise`.all()` method can be used to execute multiple promises in parallel. The function accepts an array of promises as an argument. If all of the promises in the argument are resolved, the promise returned from Promise`.all()` will resolve to an array containing the resolved values of all the promises in the order of the initial array. Any rejection from the list of promises will cause the greater promise to be rejected.

In the code block, `3` and `2` will be printed respectively even though `promise1` will be resolved after `promise2`.
```javaScript

const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve(3);
  }, 300);
});
const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve(2);
  }, 200);
});

Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then((res) => {
  console.log(res[0]);
  console.log(res[1]);
});
```
<br>
<hr>
<br>

## Executor function of JavaScript Promise object

A JavaScript promise’s executor function takes two functions as its arguments. The first parameter represents the function that should be called to resolve the promise and the other one is used when the promise should be rejected. A `Promise` object may use any one or both of them inside its executor function.

In the given example, the promise is always resolved unconditionally by the `resolve` function. The `reject` function could be used for a rejection.

```javaScript

const executorFn = (resolve, reject) => {
  resolve('Resolved!');
};

const promise = new Promise(executorFn);

```
<br>
<hr>
<br>

## .then() method of a JavaScript Promise object

The `.then()` method of a JavaScript `Promise` object can be used to get the eventual result (or error) of the asynchronous operation.

`.then()` accepts two function arguments. The first handler supplied to it will be called if the promise is resolved. The second one will be called if the promise is rejected.

```javaScript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {    
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('Result');
  }, 200);
});

promise.then((res) => {
  console.log(res);
}, (err) => {
  alert(err);
});
```

<br>
<hr>
<br>

## setTimeout()

`setTimeout()` is an asynchronous JavaScript function that executes a code block or evaluates an expression through a callback function after a delay set in milliseconds.
```javaScript

const loginAlert = () =>{
  alert('Login');
};

setTimeout(loginAlert, 6000);
```

<br>
<hr>
<br>

## Avoiding nested Promise and .then()
In JavaScript, when performing multiple asynchronous operations in a sequence, promises should be composed by chaining multiple `.then()` methods. This is better practice than nesting.

Chaining helps streamline the development process because it makes the code more readable and easier to debug.
```javaScript

const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {  
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('*');
  }, 1000);
});

const twoStars = (star) => {  
  return (star + star);
};

const oneDot = (star) => {  
  return (star + '.');
};

const print = (val) => {
  console.log(val);
};

// Chaining them all together
promise.then(twoStars).then(oneDot).then(print);
```

<br>
<hr>
<br>

## Creating a Javascript Promise object
An instance of a JavaScript `Promise` object is created using the `new` keyword.

The constructor of the `Promise` object takes a function, known as the executor function, as the argument. This function is responsible for resolving or rejecting the promise.
```javaScript
const executorFn = (resolve, reject) => {
  console.log('The executor function of the promise!');
};

const promise = new Promise(executorFn);
```

<br>
<hr>
<br>

## The Promise Object
A `Promise` is an object that can be used to get the outcome of an asynchronous operation when that result is not instantly available.

Since JavaScript code runs in a non-blocking manner, promises become essential when we have to wait for some asynchronous operation without holding back the execution of the rest of the code.
<br>
<hr>
<br>

## Chaining multiple .then() methods
The `.then()` method returns a Promise, even if one or both of the handler functions are absent. Because of this, multiple `.then()` methods can be chained together. This is known as composition.

In the code block, a couple of `.then()` methods are chained together. Each method deals with the resolved value of their respective promises.

```javaScript
const promise = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve('dAlan'), 100));

promise.then(res => {
  return res === 'Alan' ? Promise.resolve('Hey Alan!') : Promise.reject('Who are you?')
}).then((res) => {
  console.log(res)
}, (err) => {
  alert(err)
});
```

<h1> Async-Await </h1>

<hr>
<br>

## Resolving JavaScript Promises
When using JavaScript `async...await`, multiple asynchronous operations can run concurrently. If the resolved value is required for each promise initiated, `Promise.all()` can be used to retrieve the resolved value, avoiding unnecessary blocking.
```javaScript
let promise1 = Promise.resolve(5);
let promise2 = 44;
let promise3 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'foo');
});

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then(function(values) {
  console.log(values);
});
// expected output: Array [5, 44, "foo"]
```
<br>
<hr>
<br>

## Creating async Function
An asynchronous JavaScript function can be created with the `async` keyword before the `function` name, or before `()` when using the arrow function syntax. An `async` function returns a promise.
```javaScript
function helloWorld() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('Hello World!');
    }, 2000);
  });
}

const msg = async function() { //Async Function Expression
  const msg = await helloWorld();
  console.log('Message:', msg);
}

const msg1 = async () => { //Async Arrow Function
  const msg = await helloWorld();
  console.log('Message:', msg);
}

msg(); // Message: Hello World! <-- after 2 seconds
msg1(); // Message: Hello World! <-- after 2 seconds
```
<br>
<hr>
<br>

## Async Await Promises
The `async...await` syntax in ES6 offers a new way write more readable and scalable code to handle promises. It uses the same features that were already built into JavaScript.
```javaScript

function helloWorld() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('Hello World!');
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function msg() {
  const msg = await helloWorld();
  console.log('Message:', msg);
}

msg(); // Message: Hello World! <-- after 2 seconds
```
<br>
<hr>
<br>

## Using async await syntax
Constructing one or more promises or calls without `await` can allow multiple `async` functions to execute simultaneously. Through this approach, a program can take advantage of concurrency, and asynchronous actions can be initiated within an `async` function. Since using the `await` keyword halts the execution of an `async` function, each async function can be awaited once its value is required by program logic.
<br>
<hr>
<br>
## JavaScript async…await advantage
The JavaScript `async...await` syntax allows multiple promises to be initiated and then resolved for values when required during execution of the program. As an alternate to chaining `.then()` functions, it offers better maintainablity of the code and a close resemblance synchronous code.
<br>
<hr>
<br>

## Async Function Error Handling
JavaScript async functions uses `try...catch` statements for error handling. This method allows shared error handling for synchronous and asynchronous code.
```javaScript

let json = '{ "age": 30 }'; // incomplete data

try {
  let user = JSON.parse(json); // <-- no errors
  alert( user.name ); // no name!
} catch (e) {
  alert( "Invalid JSON data!" );
}

```
<br>
<hr>
<br>

## The aysnc and await Keywords
The `async…await` ES6 JavaScript syntax offers a new way to write more readable and scalable code to handle promises. A JavaScript `async` function can contain statements preceded by an `await` operator. The operand of `await` is a promise. At an `await` expression, the execution of the `async` function is paused and `waits` for the operand promise to resolve. The `await` operator returns the promise’s resolved value. An `await` operand can only be used inside an `async` function.
```javaScript

function helloWorld() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('Hello World!');
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function msg() {
  const msg = await helloWorld();
  console.log('Message:', msg);
}

msg(); // Message: Hello World! <-- after 2 seconds

```

<h1>Review</h1>
<br>
<h3>Awesome work getting the hang of the async...await syntax! Let’s review what you’ve learned:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>async...await is syntactic sugar built on native JavaScript promises and generators.</li>
  <li>We declare an async function with the keyword async.
</li>
  <li>Inside an async function we use the await operator to pause execution of our function until an asynchronous action completes and the awaited promise is no longer pending .
</li>
  <li>await returns the resolved value of the awaited promise.
</li>
  <li>We can write multiple await statements to produce code that reads like synchronous code.
</li>
  <li>We use try...catch statements within our async functions for error handling.
</li>
  <li>We should still take advantage of concurrency by writing async functions that allow asynchronous actions to happen in concurrently whenever possible.
</li>

</ul>
